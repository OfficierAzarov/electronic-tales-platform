# Welcome to Electronic Tales Platform repository!

Thanks to the popularization of bootcamps, more and more profiles that are not "born to be dev" are entering the world of programming. And that's good 👏

But once in the company, these people often face a "glass wall" from their colleagues from more traditional backgrounds, built on cultural or technical references they don't have. The consequences? Workplace discomfort, career abandonment... and impostor syndrome, a widespread problem in the tech world.

Let's get rid of the impostor syndrome together!

Electronic Tales intends to be a safe learning space for and by junior devs, focused on kindness and inclusion. It aims to close the gap between bootcampers/self-starters and engineers by talking about everything short courses don't teach 💾 🔋 🕹️
